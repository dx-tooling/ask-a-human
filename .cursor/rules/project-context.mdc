# Project Context Loading

Before starting any task, read these files to understand the project:

## Required Reading (Every Session)

1. **`HOWTO.md`** - Project structure and workflow overview
2. **`planning/tasks/task-management.md`** - How to work with tasks
3. **`planning/tasks/in-progress/`** - Check for active work
4. **`planning/tasks/todo/`** - Available tasks

## Reference as Needed

- **`planning/fundamentals/`** - Core constraints, accounts, credentials
- **`planning/architectural-decision-records/`** - Technical decisions (ADRs)
- **`planning/product-requirements-document/`** - Feature specs (PRDs)
- **`planning/memory/`** - Learnings, patterns, gotchas, conventions

## Task Workflow

When working on tasks, follow the process in `task-management.md`:

1. **Start**: Move task from `todo/` to `in-progress/`, add `started:` date
2. **Work**: Check off acceptance criteria, capture learnings in `planning/memory/`
3. **Complete**: Move to `done/`, add `completed:` date, update ADRs/PRDs if needed

## Key Principles

- Tasks reference source ADRs/PRDs - read them for full context
- Update documentation when implementation reveals better approaches
- Capture non-obvious learnings in `planning/memory/`
- Never commit secrets from `secrets/` directory
