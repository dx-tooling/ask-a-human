# Project Memory

This folder contains accumulated knowledge and learnings from implementing the Ask-a-Human project.

## Purpose

- Capture hard-won insights that would otherwise be forgotten
- Prevent repeating mistakes
- Build institutional knowledge
- Help future contributors (human or AI) understand project context

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `learnings.md` | Key insights discovered during implementation |
| `gotchas.md` | Non-obvious pitfalls and how to avoid them |
| `conventions.md` | Project-specific patterns and standards |
| `debugging-tips.md` | How to diagnose common issues |

## How to Contribute

When you learn something worth remembering:

1. Find or create the appropriate file
2. Add a dated entry with context
3. Keep entries concise and scannable
4. Reference the source (task, ADR, PRD) when relevant

## Entry Format

```markdown
### Short Descriptive Title (YYYY-MM-DD)

What you learned, in 1-3 sentences.
Why it matters or when it applies.
Source: Task XX / ADR-XX / debugging session.
```

## When to Add Entries

- After completing a task
- After solving a tricky problem
- After debugging for 30+ minutes
- When you discover something non-obvious
- When you wish past-you had left a note
